//Converting Array to Strings

let myCollection = ["Mera Junoon na rokein ge kabhi ye silsile","Aey Jazbae Dil gar mein chahoon","Khudi ka sirre nihan"];

//The join method joins all array elements with the element in between is the one which is passed as an argument in join function
let joinedArray = myCollection.join(" - ");
console.clear();
console.log("Joined array is equal to \n", joinedArray);

//So joined array is cleared now
